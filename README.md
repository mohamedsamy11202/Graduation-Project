# Graduation-Project
Final year graduation project repository: ASIC Design and Verification of MIPI I3C Protocol with FPGA Prototyping. Includes RTL design, verification environment, FPGA implementation, and documentation,(Under supervision of Prof. Dr. Ghazal Abd El-Atey Fahmy) 

• Title: ASIC Design and FPGA Implantation of MIPI I3C Protocol  
• Description: 
Executed a complete ASIC design flow for the MIPI I3C protocol, starting from the official specification 
through to GDSII file generation, alongside FPGA prototyping for functional validation. Developed the 
entire RTL in Verilog, performed simulation and verification using QuestaSim, and used Synopsys tools  
for synthesis, floorplanning, placement and routing. TCL scripting was extensively used to automate 
tool flows, configure constraints, and manage reports, ensuring consistent and repeatable results 
across design stages. 

• Key Highlights: 
o Studied the MIPI I3C v1.1.1 standard in depth and extracted all protocol specifications manually to 
define and implement the RTL architecture 
o Synthesized RTL, achieving timing closure based on target frequency 
o Implemented both controller and target blocks of the MIPI I3C protocol in Verilog 
o Used TCL to automate flow scripts for Synopsys tools, including synthesis, constraints setup, timing 
reports, and design rule checks 
o Performed floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, and routing  
o Generated final GDSII file, completing the physical design stage 
o Also verified functionality using FPGA prototyping on Vivado 
o Gained full exposure to RTL design, verification, and backend physical design flow
